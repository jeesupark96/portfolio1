        <p>Hey, my name is Jeesu Park, and I am currently 25 years old pursuing a career in software engineering.
          After I had initially graduated from college, I had the dream of serving as a pastor, so I naturally went and
          applied for Seminary School here in La Mirada. After about a year, I had realized that although being a pastor was still
         something I was passionate about, it was not something that could provide me financial security for my future.
          I had always had an interest in coding and web development, and now I am excited to start my journey here.  </p>
         <p>Some hobbies that I enjoy are watching my favorite NBA team, the LA Clippers, and going out to play sports with my friends.
         Although I know that this job will require me to stay indoors for many hours of the day, I am still looking forward to spending time
          with my girlfriend enjoying the many amenities of Los Angeles, and also finding ways to stay active.</p>
